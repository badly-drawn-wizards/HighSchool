    <h1>Designing a shader</h1>
    <p>
        FancyShader uses GLSL. The GLSL in FancyShader describes a program 
        that runs for each pixel on the preview canvas with the pixel coordinate
        as the input and the pixel color as the output. For example the GLSL program:
    </p>
    <code>
        uniform vec2 resolution; <br/>
        void main() { <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// normalize the coordinates from pixel dimensions to unit dimensions <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vec2 position = gl_FragCoord.xy/resolution; <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// GLSL colors are represented as 4-dimensional vectors containing red, blue, green and opacity values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gl_FragColor = vec4(position.x); <br/>
        }
    </code>
    <p>
        is a grayscale gradient that goes from black to white as one goes from left to right. This is a public demo <b>Example 1 (Greyscale Gradient)</b>.
        One can see that <b>gl_FragCoord</b> was not the only input. The uniform <b>resolution</b> was also inputted, which is a vector 
        containing the preview canvas pixel dimensions. Another such uniform provided by FancyShader is <b>time</b> which is a <b>float</b> 
        rather than a <b>vec2</b>. This allows for animation to be introduced.
    </p>

        If the code entered is invalid and does not compile, the error shader will be shown. This can be seen in the public demo <b>Example 2 (Error Shader)</b>
