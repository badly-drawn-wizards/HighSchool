            <p>
                There are groups of people who strive to bring art, math and programming
                together in the form of procedurally generated visual displays. These people
                identify themselves as the demo scene. The programs they create are demos.
            </p>

            <p>
                FancyShader is a utility used to browse, view, edit and share demos programmed
                as a shader in GLSL. Shaders were created with the intent to provide a programmable
                element in the transition from rasterized fragments in the 3D rendering pipeline of
                graphics cards to the final pixel colours outputted to the screen, but it has an alternative
                use case within the demo scene.
