My high school Practical Assessment Task and Data Aware Task both made in Netbeans. 
I decided to upload it as is. The shaders folder contains shader code that I manually copied so they may be inspected without running the program.

At the time I was aware that:

   * version control and dependency management existed
   * the distribution could be automated by a build script
   * singletons are bad
   * using RMI for end-user client to server interaction is bad
   * sending plain-text passwords over unencrypted channels are bad and completely invalidate hashing and salting them on the database.
   * fetching the implementation of SHA to use for password hashing means that passwords on the database are non-portable
   * getting a GL context working inside JavaFX was a dirty hack
    
However, I had met the requirements of the project and did not feel the need to elaborate further.
    
I am also aware that this whole project structure is messed up and binaries in Git are bad . I just want a place to both archive and showcase my growth as a programmer. Therefore I do not want to change the structure of this project to cater for best practices, and rather use them in further projects.
